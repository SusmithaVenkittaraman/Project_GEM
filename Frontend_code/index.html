                <br><br>
                <p>Entrepreneurship is an essential driver of societal health and wealth. It is considered a  formidable engine of economic growth. Entrepreneurship promotes the essential innovation to build new opportunities, boost productivity and create employment. Through offering unique goods and services, entrepreneurs break away from tradition and reduce dependence on obsolete systems and technologies. This can result in an improved quality of life, improved morale, and greater economic freedom. Entrepreneurial ventures help generate new wealth. Existing businesses may remain confined to existing markets and may hit a limit in terms of income. New and improved products, services, or technology from entrepreneurs enable new markets to be developed and new wealth to be created. These compelling outcomes make the promotion of entrepreneurship central to multiple governments for the foreseeable future, especially considering the significant impact on economies due to the pandemic.</p>
                <br><br><br>
                <h4 class="text-uppercase">Why Project-GEM (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor)?</h4>
                <br><br>
                <p>Fundamentally, entrepreneurs solve problems. But entrepreneurship happens within an economic, political, and cultural context that shapes new businesses to a remarkable degree. In one country, entrepreneurs are the highly educated elite choosing an aspirational path. In another, they are entrepreneurs-of-necessity because there are no other jobs. In some places, only the politically connected would consider launching a venture. In some, race, gender, or religion may be exclusionary, while in others, those are irrelevant factors. These differences across the regions are the compelling reasons for Project-GEM.</p>                
                <p>The project helps in better understanding of,</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The perspectives of an entrepreneur on the country or the entrepreneurial ecosystem.</li>
                    <li>The factors that give entrepreneurs the confidence that they can build successful, value-adding and profitable companies. </li>
                    <li>The difference in government support and policies across different economies.</li>
                </ol>
                <br><br><br>
                <h3 class="text-uppercase">Outcome</h3>
                <br><br>
                <p></p>
                <p>The decision to start a new business is the product of an individual’s attitudes, perceptions, and intentions, set within a social, cultural, and political context that could support or constrain that decision. The Behaviour and Attitudes dashboard gives a clear picture of perspectives the entrepreneurs have across various dimensions. The data from the past 20 years help stakeholders and the governments understand the trend over the years in different countries. The map visualizes the current measures across the world. </p>
                <p>GEM assesses the environment for enterprise by defining a number of specific Entrepreneurship Framework Conditions. These conditions, taken together, specify a local environment for enterprise that, for the person trying to start a new venture, will be supportive in some ways and constraining in others. Individually and collectively, these conditions influence how easy, or how difficult, it is to start a new business and then develop that new venture into a sustainable established business.</p>
                <br><br><br>
                <h3 class="text-uppercase">Caveats</h3>
                <br><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The data set is limited. The data has been collected for 113 unique countries, limiting that not all 113 countries have the data points every year. Also, not all the parameters were available for each country surveyed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The map was plotted only for the year 2019 as the data was not available for the years 2020 and 2021.
                    </li>
